## What is this?

On April 1, 2021, dbrand started selling face masks again. You were able to add a "Surprise" to your purchase for an extra 10 USD, which turned out to be a robot camo mask.

Once the face masks started getting delivered after they shipped on April 12, 2021, the robot camo mask also included a card like the following:

| Back  | Front |
| --- | --- |
| ![Back Card](acquiredSymbols/0-backCard.png) | ![Front Card](acquiredSymbols/E-2.png) |

Using the Zodiac Z340 Cipher the back text decrypts to `POSTANDSEARCHONTWITTER`. This is the same on every card.
On the front of the card there is a singular Zodiac Killer Symbol. These can vary and we are looking for such symbols!

We have a bunch of dipshits on Discord that have been trying to figure out what exactly the backs of the cards are supposed to mean.

If you have a symbol please post the image in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dbrand) or [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand)!, additionally you can post it on Twitter using [#CTC2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTC2).

Cards that have been collected so far can be seen [here](/acquiredSymbols).
