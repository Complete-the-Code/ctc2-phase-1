## What is this?

On April 1, 2021, dbrand started selling face masks. You were able to add a "Surprise gift" to your purchase for some extra cash, which turned out to be a robot camo mask.

Once the face masks started getting delivered after they shipped on April 12, 2021, the robot camo mask also included a card like the following:

![Card Front](card_front.jpeg)

This means "POSTANDSEARCHONTWITTER" in the Zodiac Killer Cipher. This is the same on every card. 
On the back card there is another Zodiac Killer Symbol. These can vary and we are looking for these symbols!

If you have a new symbol (The symbols we allready have are shown above, please post the image in the Discord, Twitter or Reddit!

The front of the card translates to `POSTANDFINDONTWITTER` if decrypted with the Zodiac Z340 cipher, which was cracked in December of 2020 (see [here](http://zodiackillersite.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5079) for more information).

Since then, a bunch of dipshits on Discord have been trying to figure out what exactly the backs of the cards are supposed to mean.
