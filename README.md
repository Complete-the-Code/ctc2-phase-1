## Current solve status
Still currently unsolved. Cards that have been collected so far can be seen [here](/acquiredSymbols).

As of May 17, 2021, dbrand has "confirmed" that a total of 23 cards have been acknowledged, you can see the message [here](https://discord.com/channels/520021794380447745/832309320934621234/837808784562716763) (If you're in the Discord), or below.
Additionally they have confirmed that we have everything needed, to solve this challange.

Given the clue `symbols < cards` we've concluded that we are looking for 3 words made up of 21 characters and two other unknowns.
While we initially assumed those to be spaces, recent messages led us to conclude otherwise.

## What is this?

On April 1, 2021, dbrand started selling face masks again. You were able to add a "Surprise" to your purchase for an extra 10 USD, which turned out to be a robot camo mask.

Once the face masks started getting delivered after they shipped on April 12, 2021, the robot camo mask also included a card like the following:

| Back  | Front |
| --- | --- |
| ![Back Card](acquiredSymbols/0-backCard.png) | ![Front Card](acquiredSymbols/E-2.png) |

Using the Zodiac Z340 Cipher the back text decrypts to `POSTANDSEARCHONTWITTER`. This is the same on every card.
On the front of the card there is a singular Zodiac Killer Symbol. These can vary and we are looking for such symbols!

We have a bunch of dipshits on Discord that have been trying to figure out what exactly the backs of the cards are supposed to mean.

If you have a symbol please post the image in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dbrand) or [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand)!, additionally you can post it on Twitter using [#CTC2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTC2).
