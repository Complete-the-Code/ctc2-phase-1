## Current solve status
Still currently unsolved. Cards that have been collected so far can be seen [here](/acquiredSymbols).

As of May 17, 2021, dbrand has "confirmed" that all 23 cards have been acquired, you can see the message in the pinned section of the CTC2 discord channel.
Additionally they have confirmed that we have everything needed, to solve this challange.

Given the clue `symbols < cards`, we've concluded that we are looking for a phrase made up of 21 characters and two other unknowns.
We believe these two unknowns are duplicate symbols. Using our brains, we've deduced that the two duplicate characters can be `C` `D` `H` or `M`.
robot069 has "confirmed" this theory as of May 25, 2021.

## What is this?

On April 1, 2021, dbrand started selling face masks again. You were able to add a "Surprise" to your purchase for an extra 10 USD, which turned out to be a robot camo mask.

Once the face masks started getting delivered after they shipped on April 12, 2021, the robot camo mask also included a card like the following:

| Back  | Front |
| --- | --- |
| ![Back Card](acquiredSymbols/0-backCard.png) | ![Front Card](acquiredSymbols/E-2.png) |

Using the Zodiac Z340 Cipher the back text decrypts to `POSTANDSEARCHONTWITTER`. This is the same on every card.
On the front of the card there is a singular Zodiac Killer Symbol. These can vary and we are looking for such symbols!

We have a bunch of dipshits on Discord that have been trying to figure out what exactly the backs of the cards are supposed to mean.

If you have a symbol please post the image in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dbrand) or [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand)!, additionally you can post it on Twitter using [#CTC2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTC2).
